# CVE-2021-3156

## Introduction

>This repository was created for studying purpose. The project contains some tools for studying the vulnerability and the exploit.
>Thanks to [Qualys Team](https://www.qualys.com/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156/baron-samedit-heap-based-overflow-sudo.txt) for discover such vulnerability, to [Worawit](https://github.com/worawit/CVE-2021-3156) and [0xdevil](https://github.com/0xdevil/CVE-2021-3156) for the good writeups.

## Usage

> The Docker directory contains a Docker container used for studying some part of the vulnerability:
- Use ``` make all ``` for starting the container.
- Use ``` make root ``` for open a shell as root.
- Use ``` make user ``` for open a shell as user.

> Care that the exploit will not work on the Docker container, at least not on ```Mac OS Big Sur``` with ```docker-machine```

> The environment directory contains ```debug.py``` and ```gdb_config``` used for debugging sudo. The subdirectory ``` src ``` contains some part of the source code.
> The ``` source ``` directory contains all the sudo code.
> the ``` exploit ``` directory contains the python exploit devolped for this project and the malicious library used for spawn a root shell.
- Compile the C program ``` gcc -shared -o X1234.so.2 -fPIC X1234.c ```
- Run the exploit ``` python3 exploit.py ```
- Enjoi the root shell

> The exploit was tested on :
- ```Ubuntu 20.04 ```
- ```ldd (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.31-0ubuntu9) 2.31 Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.```
- ``` sudo version: 1.8.31```
> it should not work on other version. In that case just try to change the number of things that you are putting into the heap.
